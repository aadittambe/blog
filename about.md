## Hi 👋🏽 — thanks for stopping by!

This blog is owned and operated by me, Aadit Tambe. 

Currently, I am a data reporting fellow at the [Howard Center for Investigative Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/howard-center-for-investigative-journalism) at the University of Maryland. I am earning a master's degree in journalism with a data and computational focus. 

Since starting in data and graphics journalism about two years ago, I have taken the help of countless blogs, YouTube tutorials and internet walkthroughs to understand programming concepts, which have helped me find, report and tell powerful data-driven, visual stories. I want to do the same for others.

My goal with this blog is to feature and write about methods, tools, documentation for libraries, and other useful hacks I learn.

If you want to know more about my background and what I work on, you can head to my [personal website](https://aadittambe.com/). If you want to see my code — including the repository that powers this blog and my website — you can head to my [GitHub page](https://github.com/aadittambe).

Thank you for reading! 

*P.S. — I am still learning. If you see that I've gotten something wrong, [please do let me know](mailto:aadit.tambe@gmail.com).*
