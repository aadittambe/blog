# Hi 👋🏽 — thanks for stopping by! 

This blog features methods and documentation for libraries, tools and other resources useful for data and graphics journalism. My goal is to make documentation easier to read and understand, and share weird and helpful hacks I learn.

[Hope you find it helpful in some way.](https://blog.aadittambe.com/)

I am still learning. If you see that I've gotten something wrong — or if you think my methods sucks — please do let me know.
