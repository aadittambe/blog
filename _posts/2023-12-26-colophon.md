## Introduction

This website — created as a separate instance for my subdomain — was developed on a MacBook Pro laptop.

## Development stack

The site is written in HTML, SCSS, Markdown, with a touch of JavaScript. Jekyll is used for blog-aware, static-page generation. It is written in Ruby. Git is used for version control, and GitHub is used to store the repository. GitHub Pages is used for deployment.

## Coding environment

VSCode was used as a code editor. iTerm2, an open-source framework for managing Zsh configurations, was used as a terminal emulator.

## Typography

The typeface used is system-ui, which results in Segoe on Windows, San Francisco on macOS, and Roboto on Android.

## Accessibility testing

EqualWeb Accessibility Checker, a free, Google Chrome extension, was used as for accessibility testing.

## Tracking

The site uses Google Analytics for tracking web traffic.
